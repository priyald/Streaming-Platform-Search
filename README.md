# Streaming-Platform-Search
Check whether a movie or show is on the streaming platforms you own or not.

<h2>To-Do</h2>

Create a GUI/modular version for users to easily navigate. Should include:</li>
<ul>
  <li>Being able to search for shows and movies</li>
  <li>Being able to add streaming sites owned and their subscription level to database</li>
</ul>

Also, implement immediate links to webpages/apps where show is available to watch. Raise error if the webpages/apps are not logged in once personalised. 

Side note: also make csv file personal and accessible to each user
