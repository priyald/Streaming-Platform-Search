# Streaming-Platform-Search

<h1>Movie & TV Show Streaming Platform Finder</h1>

<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This project is a web scraping application that allows users to search for movies and TV shows, displaying which streaming platforms they are available on. Future versions of the app will allow users to personalize results based on their active streaming subscriptions, providing direct links to the content and handling login errors gracefully.</p>

<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Movie/TV Show Search:</strong> Enter a movie or TV show title and retrieve a list of available streaming platforms.</li>
    <li><strong>Personalized Streaming Results (Planned):</strong> Filter results to show only platforms you're subscribed to.</li>
    <li><strong>Direct Streaming Links (Planned):</strong> Click a direct link to the streaming platform for easy access to the content. The app will handle errors if you are not logged in.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Current Implementation</h2>
<p>The current implementation scrapes data from all available streaming platforms to show where movies and TV shows can be found.</p>

<h2>Future Development</h2>
<ul>
    <li>User Personalization: Add functionality allowing users to input their streaming subscriptions to refine search results.</li>
    <li>Platform Links: Enable direct links to the streaming platforms for quick access.</li>
    <li>Error Handling: Implement login error detection to notify users if they are not logged in to the relevant streaming service.</li>
</ul>
